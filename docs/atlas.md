## **Gamified Learning Platform \- Concept Note**

### **Overview**

To improve engagement, accountability, and learning outcomes across the LaunchPad Fellowship, we propose the development of a custom, LMS-like gamified learning platform tailored specifically to the LaunchPad experience. For now, this is called ATLAS

The goal of this platform is to:

* Centralize all learning resources  
* Drive consistent engagement with session content  
* Encourage healthy competition and accountability  
* Reward depth of learning, not speed or skimming  
* Give the LaunchPad team clear visibility into fellow participation and behavior

This platform will support the Fellowship’s four-month structure and align directly with the monthly themes and session cadence.

### **Core Learning Experience**

#### **Resource Structure & Access Control**

* All session resources (articles, videos, exercises) will live exclusively on the platform.  
* Resources for each session will be locked by default.  
* Resources will automatically unlock 8 days before the scheduled session.  
* Once unlocked, resources remain accessible for the rest of the fellowship.  
* This ensures fellows focus only on *relevant, timely content* and reduces cognitive overload.

### **Gamification Framework**

#### **Points & Progression System**

Fellows earn points based on meaningful engagement, not just completion.

Points can be awarded for:

* Completing all core resources for a session  
* Completing optional deep-dive resources  
* Spending adequate time on articles and videos  
* Answering reflection questions correctly or thoughtfully  
* Participating in session-related prompts or quizzes  
* Consistent weekly engagement

The system must actively discourage skimming or rushing content.

### **Anti-Skimming & Engagement Integrity**

To ensure quality learning, the platform should include:

* Time-on-content tracking for both videos and articles  
* Video completion rules (e.g., cannot skip to end)  
* Minimum engagement thresholds before marking a resource as “completed”  
* Embedded reflection questions or checkpoints within content  
* Session-specific quizzes or prompts tied to unlocked resources

Completion should only be validated when engagement criteria are met.

### **Leaderboard System**

#### **Real-Time Leaderboard**

* A real-time leaderboard displays fellow engagement and points accumulation.  
* The leaderboard reflects:  
  * Resource completion  
  * Engagement depth  
  * Timeliness (within 3-4 days of resource unlock)

#### **Monthly Reset**

* The leaderboard resets every month.  
* This aligns with the Fellowship’s monthly themes and prevents early leads from discouraging others.

#### **Fellow of the Month**

* Based on monthly leaderboard performance.  
* Selection criteria combines:  
  * Total points  
  * Engagement consistency  
  * Depth of interaction with content

### **Achievements & Badges**

To further gamify the experience, the platform will include achievements and badges, such as:

* Core Content Champion (completed all core resources)  
* Deep Diver (completed all optional resources)  
* Consistency Star (engaged every week)  
* Thought Leader (high-quality reflections or answers)  
* Top 10 Leaderboard Finisher

Achievements contribute to overall points and visibility within the platform.

### **Social Learning & Community Engagement**

#### **Social Chat Feature**

* The platform will include an in-built social chat space for fellows.  
* This space enables informal peer-to-peer engagement, collaboration, and community building.  
* Chats can be organized by:  
  * Cohort-wide discussions  
  * Monthly themes  
  * Session-specific channels

This ensures learning extends beyond structured resources into shared reflection and peer learning.

#### **Resource-Based Discussion Prompts**

* Every learning resource (article or video) will include an open discussion prompt.  
* Fellows are required to:  
  * Submit a response to the prompt  
  * Comment meaningfully on at least one other fellow’s response

Points are awarded for:

* Submitting thoughtful responses  
* Constructive engagement with peers  
* Consistency in discussions across sessions

This design encourages reflection, dialogue, and deeper understanding of session content.

### **Live Quizzes & Competitive Learning (Kahoot-style)**

#### **Timed Quiz Windows**

* The platform will support live, time-bound quizzes similar to Kahoot.  
* Quizzes:  
  * Open at a specific time set by an admin  
  * Remain open for a defined duration (e.g. 10, 20, or 30 minutes)  
  * Automatically close once the time window ends

#### **Admin-Controlled Activation**

* Only admins can:  
  * Toggle quizzes on or off  
  * Set quiz duration  
  * Decide whether points are standard, doubled, or tripled

#### **Auto-Grading & Rankings**

* Quizzes are auto-graded in real time.  
* Points are automatically awarded and reflected instantly on the leaderboard.  
* Rankings update immediately based on quiz performance.

Live quizzes serve as high-energy engagement moments and reward preparedness and speed without replacing deep learning activities.

### **Dashboards & Analytics**

#### **Fellow Dashboard**

Each fellow will have a personalized dashboard showing:

* Progress by session and month  
* Points earned  
* Badges and achievements  
* Leaderboard position  
* Upcoming unlocked resources  
* Discussion participation status

#### **Admin Dashboard**

The admin dashboard will provide deep visibility and control across the fellowship.

Admins will be able to track:

* Individual fellow engagement patterns  
* Time spent per resource (articles, videos, discussions)  
* Completion rates (core vs optional)  
* Leaderboard trends and point distribution  
* Drop-off points or low-engagement signals

#### **Session Analytics & Engagement Intelligence**

To strengthen live-session accountability and insight, the platform will include a Session Analytics Tool.

Key capabilities:

* Admins can upload:  
  * Session video recordings, or  
  * Session transcripts  
* The system analyzes sessions to assess:  
  * Fellow participation patterns  
  * Engagement indicators across the duration of the session  
  * Moments of high and low engagement

Using this analysis, admins can:

* Allocate engagement points to fellows who actively participated during sessions  
* Identify sessions or segments that need improvement  
* Correlate live-session engagement with platform activity

This ensures live attendance and participation are meaningfully recognized alongside asynchronous learning.

### **Additional Platform Features (Recommended)**

To further strengthen the LaunchPad experience, the following features are recommended:

#### **Attendance & Participation Tracking**

* Session attendance logging  
* Manual or automated participation markers  
* Integration with session analytics for holistic scoring

#### **Notifications & Nudges**

* Automated reminders when resources unlock  
* Alerts for upcoming live sessions or quizzes  
* Nudges for incomplete core resources

#### **Feedback & Reflection Tools**

* Post-session feedback forms  
* Anonymous suggestions for program improvement  
* End-of-month reflection prompts

#### **Permissions & Roles**

* Role-based access (Admin, Facilitator, Fellow)  
* Facilitators have early access to all session resources assigned to them for preparation and alignment  
* Facilitators can view:  
  * Session-specific resources  
  * Discussion prompts  
  * Aggregated session-level analytics  
* Facilitators do **not** have access to full cohort-wide admin controls unless explicitly granted

### **Why This Matters**

This enhanced admin layer ensures:

* Fair and transparent point allocation  
* Data-informed facilitation and curriculum improvement  
* Recognition of both live and asynchronous engagement

The platform becomes not just a learning tool, but an intelligence system for running high-quality cohorts.

### **Next Steps (Proposed)**

* Finalize feature scope and prioritization  
* Translate this concept into a Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
* Define scoring rules and safeguards  
* Explore technical feasibility for session analytics and media analysis

This platform is envisioned as a core pillar of the LaunchPad Fellowship experience, not just a content repository.
