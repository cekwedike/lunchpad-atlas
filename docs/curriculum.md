## **THRiVE LaunchPad Fellowship – Cohort 4 Curriculum (2026)**

### **Introduction**

The THRiVE LaunchPad Fellowship curriculum for Cohort 4 (2026) has been intentionally reviewed and refreshed to reflect changes in the world of work since the first cohort in 2023\. Over the last few years, shifts in hiring practices, the rise of remote and global work, the mainstream adoption of AI tools, and evolving career paths have made it necessary to rethink what we teach and how we teach it.

As part of this review, some topics have been renamed to better reflect modern workplace realities, others have been merged or replaced to remove repetition, and several new topics have been introduced to address critical 2026‑relevant skills such as AI literacy, execution at work, and career agility. These changes ensure the fellowship remains practical, forward‑looking, and aligned with what LaunchPad fellows actually need to succeed.

The curriculum is now organised around monthly central themes. This thematic approach improves flow, reduces cognitive overload, and helps fellows clearly understand what each phase of the fellowship is preparing them for. Each month also includes a dedicated storytelling session, where experienced professionals are invited to share key lessons from their career journeys that fellows can learn directly from.

Based on performance metrics from previous cohorts, Wednesday sessions have been removed. Attendance and engagement were consistently lower during mid‑week sessions, and this adjustment allows us to concentrate energy on well‑attended Saturday sessions. In addition, sessions have now been extended into the fourth month of the fellowship. This change addresses the uneven engagement previously observed when some fellows were already on internships while others were not, ensuring continued structure, learning, and value for all participants through the full fellowship duration.
